In laravel without using artisian command can we execute the migration after deploying the laravel project in shared server?
Yes, you can execute migrations in Laravel 2026 on a shared server without using the command line (Terminal/SSH). This is commonly done by calling the Artisan command programmatically through a route or controller. 
1. Using a Web Route (Recommended)
You can define a temporary route in your routes/web.php file. When you visit this URL in your browser, Laravel will trigger the migration command internally. 
php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Artisan;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('/run-migrations', function () {
    // The '--force' flag is required for production environments
    Artisan::call('migrate', ["--force" => true]);
    return "Migrations executed successfully!";
});
Use code with caution.

2. Implementation Requirements
The --force Flag: Shared hosting is often treated as a "production" environment by Laravel. Commands that modify the database require the --force flag to run without interactive user confirmation.
Environment Setup: Ensure your .env file is already updated with your shared server's database credentials before calling this route.
Security: Do not leave this route public. Once your migrations are complete, delete the route or protect it with an admin middleware to prevent unauthorized database resets. 
3. Alternative: Manual SQL Import
If the programmatic method fails due to server restrictions (like execution timeouts), you can:
Run php artisan migrate --pretend on your local machine to see the raw SQL queries.
Copy these SQL queries and run them directly in your shared hosting's database tool (e.g., phpMyAdmin).
